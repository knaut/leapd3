#LeapD3

LeapD3 is a simple visualizer application for the Leap device. It uses D3.js to render scalable vector graphics (SVG) in the browser.

This is a work in progress and not yet designed for public consumption, however, feel free to pick it apart or hack it for your own ends.

##How to Install
LeapD3 runs in the browser. Simply open the index.html file (while your Leap device is plugged in and the Leap application is running) and the visualizer should start. If something goes wrong, let me know.

I'm currently working on a NodeJs version of the visualizer that sends OSC signals. That can be found at: https://github.com/knaut/nodeleapd3

Future development will primarily be on NodeLeapD3, but this simple application is a nice proof of concept.

##Todos
- fix color channel toggle bug

##Wishlist
- righthand drawer with osc channel outputs & readouts
- store data sessions with mongodb and add visualized playback (JSON loops) - bottom/top drawer?
